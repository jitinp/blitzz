### installation

```bash
composer require flagrow/upload
```

### updating

```bash
composer update flagrow/upload
php flarum cache:clear
```

### configuration

Enable the extension, a new tab will appear on the left hand side. This separate settings page allows you to further configure the extension.

Make sure you configure the upload permission on the permissions page as well.

#### Mimetype regular expression

Regular expressions allow you a lot of freedom, but they are also very difficult to understand. Here are some pointers, but feel free to ask
for help on the official Flarum forums.

In case you want to allow all regular file types including video, music, compressed files and images, use this:

```text
(video\/(3gpp|mp4|mpeg|quicktime|webm))|(audio\/(aiff|midi|mpeg|mp4))|(image\/(gif|jpeg|png))|(application\/(x-(7z|rar)-compressed|zip|arj|x-(bzip2|gzip|lha|stuffit|tar)|pdf))
```

A mimetype consists of a primary and secondary type. The primary type can be `image`, `video` and `application` for instance. The secondary
is like a more detailed specification, eg `png`, `pdf` etc. These two are divided by a `/`, in regex you have to escape this character by using: `\/`.


### donate

## FAQ

-  __AWS S3__: you will need to install the league AWS s3 adapter: `composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3`, the aws-s3 choice will now pop up in the admin settings page.
-  __flarum-ext- prefix__: I am aware that the convention is to prefix an extension with `flarum-ext-`, after considerate investigation I came to the conclusion that using the exact package name flarum-ext-upload prevented me to enable the extension in the admin panel with an error "route not found".
